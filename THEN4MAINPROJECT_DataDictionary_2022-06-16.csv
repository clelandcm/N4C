In order to do this, we need as much contact information for you as possible, in case anything changes like your phone number or your living situation. So we are asking for your contact information as well as the names, addresses, and phone numbers of your friends, counselors, doctors, job, or family members. These can be people in New York, New Jersey, or elsewhere in the world - just anyone who would have contact with you. 

We will ask you a lot of different ways that we might contact you. If you don't feel comfortable with us contacting you through a certain person or in a certain way, <b> please don't give us that information </b>.

Whenever we try to contact you or any of your contacts, we will just say you are a part of a ""community health project"" and won't mention any information about you, what the N4 Connect Project is about, or the names of any specific agencies in order to protect your confidentiality.
